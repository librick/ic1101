# Binaries

This directory and its subdirectories include compiled non-vendor binaries taken from the headunit.

The ONLY binaries included are non-proprietary binaries compiled from the Android Open Source Project (AOSP).
In theory, you could build these yourself given the appropriate ARM toolchain and the appropriate Android source.

They're included here for convenience only and the list of binaries is non-exhaustive.
