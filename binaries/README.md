# Binaries

This directory and its subdirectories contains headunit binaries that
were generated from AOSP source code. In theory, they could be regenerated
with the appropriate ARM toolchain and AOSP source, and thus do not infringe
the copyright of Mitsubishi Motors Corporation and/or Honda Motor Co., Ltd.

Binaries are included here for convenience and for those who accidentally
delete binaries from their headunits.
