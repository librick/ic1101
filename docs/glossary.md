# Glossary
The source code contains a lot of acronyms. I've documented some here.

- ERC - Early Reverse Camera
    - This refers to the application/process that runs early in the Android boot process
    - You can find it at `/sbin/earlyrvc` in the recovery image
- RVC - Reverse Camera
- HFL - Hands Free Link
- LVDS - Low Voltage Differential Signalling
    - This is used in the context of an LVDS serializer
    - LVDS is commonly used for high-speed video, graphics, and video camera data transfers
    - It's possible that LVDS is used for the headunit display and/or backup camera; more research is needed to confirm this
