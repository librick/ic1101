# SPI
- The A3G4250D chip is connected via SPI
- The product page for A3G4250D describes it as a
>3-axis digital gyroscope for automotive telematics, navigation applications, AEC-Q100 qualified ...
>The A3G4250D is a low-power 3-axis angular rate sensor able to provide unprecedented stability at zero rate level and sensitivity over temperature and time. It includes a sensing element and an IC interface capable of providing the measured angular rate to the external world through a standard SPI digital interface. An I2C-compatible interface is also available.
