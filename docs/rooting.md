# Existing Resources
There are already a few existing resources on rooting Honda headunits, which may be applicable to the 2021 Honda Civic as well, I haven't tried yet.
- Rooting 2016 Honda Pilot, XDA: https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/guide-how-to-gain-root-shell-on-2016-honda-pilot-and-now-install-apps.3487644/
- Rooting 2016 Honda Pilot, GitHub: https://github.com/jersacct/2016PilotOneClick
- DirtyCow exploit: https://github.com/timwr/CVE-2016-5195

I rooted my 2021 Honda Civic by using this paid service: http://www.autohack.org/vehicles/.
I went with the $25 option. It appears to use a WebKit exploit and likely an exploit for Android 4.2.2 to achieve root.
One of my motivations for starting this project is that I want to have an open source alternative to proprietary tools like this.
But at the time of writing, that service is the easiest/fastest way to root the headunit.
It worked for me, but use it at your own risk.
